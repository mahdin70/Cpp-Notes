#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()    // main() is where program execution begins.
{
   cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
   return 0;
}

1. The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is needed. There can be headers like <bits/stdc++.h> and more

2. The line using "namespace std" ; tells the compiler to use the "std" namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.

3. The next line "// main() is where program execution begins." is a single-line comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of the line.

4. The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.

5. The next line cout << "Hello World"; causes the message "Hello World" to be displayed on the screen.

6. The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.
